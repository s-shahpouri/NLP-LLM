"First I must say out of the box I'd rate this tablet 3 stars for a few reasons.1)No Google Play store (which means no Google apps) and stuck with Amazon App Store.2)Have to pay $15 to remove ad filled lockscreenHowever I rooted the device within 30 minutes of owning it which A)installs Google Play services and B)removes the ad lockscreen. The tablet is now easily 5 stars. I wanted something to mainly read books, magazines and news on. This does those things great. I've also tested a few videos form a few sites like Prime Video & YouTube and it works great. Sure, there are better looking tablets out there with better screens but this one works fine for what I want.Overall I'd highly recommend this tablet if you root it and install Google Play Store.

"This review is more of a guide for cablecutters, which we have found fire TV a great way to accomplish this. There's plenty of reviews explaining how to use the fire, so this is more for people like us who don't want to pay full cable prices but are ok with paying for access to apps to still watch all our cable shows, at a significant savings to cable, and are used to using a dvr (we used tivo) and don't want to watch commercials. We've had this box for a couple weeks now, and while it has taken some getting used to, since you have to access your shows through individual apps instead of them all being on one big list, we have found it worthwhile to make the switch.Keep in mind you have to be able to plug an hdmi cord into your tv. We actually had to buy a new tv to be able to use this box but tvs are so cheap nowadays that it was still cheaper to buy a new one than to keep up with our cable bill. The savings in just the first several of months covered the cost of the tv. The interface on the fire tv is really easy to use and navigate through all the apps you wish to use and everything is kept nice and organized. We got the box instead of the stick because we wanted to have a more reliable, faster wired connection to our internet. At first I was sad to read on other reviews that the voice control doesn't work on any of the apps, but honestly I've never even used it once since getting it and once you sign into everything, there's not much need of typing to find your shows on other apps so I really don't miss it at all. If you just want this to watch prime tv included in your amazon subscription then you can stop here, the rest is about what apps we use (and pay for) to watch our shows. I will list what apps we have found useful and what we found we could do without.Read more",5,2,POSITIVE,review guide cablecutter find fire tv great way accomplish s plenty review explain use fire people like don t want pay cable price ok pay access app watch cable show significant saving cable dvr tivo don t want watch commercial ve box couple week take get access show individual app instead big list find worthwhile switch mind able plug hdmi cord tv actually buy new tv able use box tv cheap nowadays cheap buy new cable bill saving month cover cost tv interface fire tv easy use navigate app wish use keep nice organize got box instead stick want reliable fast wire connection internet sad read review voice control doesn t work app honestly ve get sign s need type find show app don t miss want watch prime tv include amazon subscription stop rest app use pay watch show list app find useful find read

"Even when I’m outside in bright sunlight, the words of the book I’m reading are still crystal clear. That alone makes the Kindle Oasis worth what it cost me.The Kindle Oasis wakes up in just seconds, and any book I choose instantly opens, ready to be read.It is the perfect size and isn’t heavy or bulky. I really do read for hours at a time. Sometimes I pace the floor while I read. Sometimes I’m on my elliptical machine when I read. And sometimes I’m sitting down. No matter what I’m doing, the Kindle Oasis remains comfortable to hold, and it is always easy on my eyes.When I receive a book that is in PDF, most of the time I can enlarge the words. If it won’t allow me to enlarge the words, I can change the orientation of the page and the words are automatically larger. I am able to make notes on the book if needed, and I can highlight words and/or passages.My merlot leather cover is attractive. When I flip it open, it is just like opening the cover of a book.How to Make the Battery LastOn the Kindle Oasis page, it says that its “dual-battery charging system delivers months of battery life.” This was a huge thing for me. Instead of having to charge my tablet almost every day, I would be able to read for months without charging the Kindle!Is this how my Oasis has performed? Well, not so much. There are conditions that have to be met for the charge on your Oasis to last for two months.First, you have to limit your reading to thirty minutes a day. That one is impossible for me. There are days that I am only able to read for thirty minutes, but they don’t occur very often. My Kindle goes everywhere with me, and I use just about every spare moment to read.Second, the wireless needs to be turned off. That one is easy to do but not always easy to remember. The only time the wireless needs to be on is to download one or more books.Third, this is based on your light setting at 10. That is way too low for me. I keep my light setting anywhere from 16 to 18.I don’t limit my reading to thirty minutes a day, and I try to remember to keep my wireless turned off. My light setting is kept anywhere from 16 to 18, and I put my Kindle to sleep the second I’m done reading. So how long does a single charge last me? Ten days is the longest a charge has lasted me so far, but it would have kept a charge for several more days if I had remembered to turn my wireless off. Once I succeed in keeping my wireless off, I will let you know how long the charge lasts.Now, I don’t plug it in to charge as soon as the charge on the cover gets low. I allow my cover charge to go as low as it will possibly go and then the Kindle battery will start to drain since it can no longer charge from the cover. I allow it to drain down to about 50% before I plug the cover and Kindle into my computer to charge.The one thing that surprised me was that everything on the Oasis is in black and white. For some reason, I thought that maybe the book covers would appear in color. But since I bought the Oasis to read books on, color isn’t needed.Special offers do appear on my screen but only when my Kindle is going to sleep or waking up. They aren’t a distraction, and to be honest, they are kind of fun to look at. You can pay a higher price so they won’t appear on your Kindle if you would rather not see them.I asked myself some questions once I had my Kindle and knew just how it worked. If I had known before I bought my Kindle Oasis that the charge wouldn’t last for months, would I still have bought it? Yes, I would have. If I had known that everything would appear in black and white, would I still have bought it? Yes, I would have.",5,2,POSITIVE,m outside bright sunlight word book m read crystal clear make kindle oasis worth cost kindle oasis wakes seconds book choose instantly open ready read perfect size isn t heavy bulky read hour time pace floor read m elliptical machine read m sit matter m kindle oasis remain comfortable hold easy eye receive book pdf time enlarge word win t allow enlarge word change orientation page word automatically large able note book need highlight word passage merlot leather cover attractive flip open like open cover book battery laston kindle oasis page say dual battery charge system deliver month battery life huge thing instead have charge tablet day able read month charge kindle oasis perform condition meet charge oasis month limit read thirty minute day impossible day able read thirty minute don t occur kindle go use spare moment read second wireless need turn easy easy remember time wireless need download book base light set way low light set don t limit read thirty minute day try remember wireless turn light setting keep kindle sleep second m read long single charge day long charge last far keep charge day remember turn wireless succeed keep wireless let know long charge last don t plug charge soon charge cover get low allow cover charge low possibly kindle battery start drain long charge cover allow drain plug cover kindle computer charge thing surprise oasis black white reason think maybe book cover appear color buy oasis read book color isn t need special offer appear screen kindle go sleep wake aren t distraction honest kind fun look pay high price won t appear kindle ask question kindle know work know buy kindle oasis charge wouldn t month buy yes known appear black white buy yes

"The new Amazon Fire tablet is surprisingly good, especially for the price. The performance is good, the size is good, and the weight is good. The biggest new feature is the expandable memory slot, which is something new for this generation of Fires.There are a few downside issues, however. First, the screen has splotchy illumination from the edge lighting. There are numerous light/hot spots around the edge, especially at the bottom where the menu bar is. After a while you get used to it, but compared to other higher priced tablets it's annoying.The software library is the second biggest issue. Amazon has done a decent job in adding new software, but it's app store is nowhere near as robust as the Google and Apple stores.The last issue I have is the 90 day warranty, but that is how they keep the cost down.Amazon developed the Fire tablet to sell other Amazon products, and this tablet seems to have hit a proper balance between that and usability. Web browsing is much better than my first Kindle Fire, and I think better than browsing on an iPad. The app that surprised me the most is the e-mail client, and how easy it is to use. In my opinion, it's a LOT better than the native e-mail client on the iPad, or a Windows tablet.If the build quality as good as a iPad or Samsung tablet? No, not even close, but for $50 it's pretty good device if you don't mind dots of light around the edge.",4,2,POSITIVE,new amazon fire tablet surprisingly good especially price performance good size good weight good big new feature expandable memory slot new generation fire downside issue screen splotchy illumination edge light numerous light hot spot edge especially menu bar compare higher price tablet s annoying software library second big issue amazon decent job add new software s app store near robust google apple store issue day warranty cost amazon develop fire tablet sell amazon product tablet hit proper balance usability web browse well kindle fire think well browse ipad app surprise e mail client easy use opinion s lot well native e mail client ipad windows tablet build quality good ipad samsung tablet close s pretty good device don t mind dot light edge

Amazon Echo is a very good product for what it is supposed to do. It understands what you speak and does quite a few neat tricks. Setting it up is quite easy even for a novice.

I like it though and I am sure these minor things would be there in future.,4,2,POSITIVE,amazon echo good product suppose understand speak neat trick set easy novice thing desire integrate itune amazon major drawback connect device bluetooth workaround additional process undertake like sure minor thing future

"I read as many reviews as I could find before buying this newest Paperwhite and what struck me the most was the contrast of the bright screen versus the print. However, when I got mine, I had to put the brightness level to 19 (out of 25) to get it to a comfortable setting. Doing that makes my battery run down before I've even read two books, and that is with the airplane setting on, meaning the WIFI is off. Luckily, I bought a charger so I can charge my Paperwhite while on trips ( without my computer, in a regular outlet) or at night when I'm finished reading. Now for the positives. I love the light weight of this Kindle even with the preferred cover that shuts it into sleep mode when closed. I absolutely LOVE the dictionary feature, because it is so easy to use and it saves the words I don't know, for study. After I've learned a word's meaning, I can delete it from the list. I got the Paperwhite with the ads, because it is nice getting suggestions of books I might enjoy that I might not see otherwise. And books are easy to order from the Kindle Store and to download through this devise. I like the cover, because it protects the screen from scratches while stored in my purse and I also purchased a stylus to keep fingerprints off the screen and I like that. Generally, I am happy with this purchase.",4,2,POSITIVE,read review find buy new paperwhite strike contrast bright screen versus print get brightness level comfortable setting make battery run ve read book airplane setting meaning wifi luckily buy charger charge paperwhite trip computer regular outlet night m finish read positive love light weight kindle prefer cover shut sleep mode close absolutely love dictionary feature easy use save word don t know study ve learn word s mean delete list get paperwhite ad nice get suggestion book enjoy book easy order kindle store download devise like cover protect screen scratch store purse purchase stylus fingerprint screen like generally happy purchase

"I was looking for a good, cheap tablet for general use, and this fit the bill. The one thing that hits you outright is the build-in marketing Amazon uses in the tablet that you cannot remove. For instance, the home screen is filled with links for Amazon Video, Amazon Books, Amazon Gifts, etc, etc. You an't remove them, but I found out you can create a folder and drag each into that folder to essentially remove them.After that, install a free app for a File Manager then go in and rename the folder(s) that you create to make it easier to find apps that you hide. You will also need to install Adobe Reader to read PDF files, since it isn't installed.Another marketing scheme is that the screen saver is an ad each and every time you wake it. After a while though you get to ignore it.Performance is great - fast and easy to navigate. The built-in browser has everything you should need. Battery life looks really good. I had the screen brightness at about 1/2 power and it looked good. The screen black level is really good and the contrast makes the colors sparkle. If you turn the brightness up too high, the colors begin to wash out a little.Amazon seems to offer this tablet at a lower price in exchange for their promotions of Amazon products. Once you get around that, you see the value you get in this tablet.",4,2,POSITIVE,look good cheap tablet general use fit bill thing hit outright build marketing amazon use tablet remove instance home screen fill link amazon video amazon book amazon gift etc etc t remove find create folder drag folder essentially remove install free app file manager rename folder s create easy find app hide need install adobe reader read pdf file isn t instal marketing scheme screen saver ad time wake ignore performance great fast easy navigate build browser need battery life look good screen brightness power look good screen black level good contrast make color sparkle turn brightness high color begin wash little amazon offer tablet low price exchange promotion amazon product value tablet

"I bought this after I bought the Amazon Echo. This was actually an impulse buy. I saw it and bought it not reading any reviews on it, because I enjoyed the echo so much. It does everything the Echo does, but the sound quality is not great. When you're playing at middle volume, it's ok. The lows are there but doesn't sound good. I'm guessing I'm comparing it with the Bose mini soundlink. When you set the volume high, the bass is almost non-existent. The mids and highs are loud with the louder volume. Another difference is that with tap, you have to press the mic button to start saying commands where as with the echo, you can just say the wake up word and it will start listening to your commands. I do like the fact that it's portable. Because of that, I'm on edge of returning it and holding off until maybe another model comes out with better bass.",4,2,POSITIVE,buy buy amazon echo actually impulse buy see buy reading review enjoy echo echo sound quality great play middle volume s ok low doesn t sound good m guessing m compare bose mini soundlink set volume high bass non existent mid high loud loud volume difference tap press mic button start say command echo wake word start listen command like fact s portable m edge return hold maybe model come well bass

"This is what it has come to. You can now buy a quality tablet for $50. Amazing! Works well, just couple things. It uses amazon app store, not, Google play store.

But if you want to hold a good quality piece of hardware in your hands for not a lot of money, this is a great choice. Amazon has a philosophy. They want to make money AFTER the sale. So that's why they get you in at a low price. Also, they have created a revenue stream by selling ads. When your screen times out, it will post a ""screen saver/wallpaper"" that is an advertisement. If you want, you can go to your amazon account, pay a one time $15 fee (per unit, not per account) to get rid of them,",4,2,POSITIVE,come buy quality tablet amazing work couple thing use amazon app store google play store run os call fire base android os find app available android course big app want hold good quality piece hardware hand lot money great choice amazon philosophy want money sale s low price create revenue stream sell ad screen time post screen saver wallpaper advertisement want amazon account pay time fee unit account rid

"My primary reason for purchasing this was to control my new smart home devices. In particular, our Phillips Hue lights.

Playing music is hit or miss with my Prime account... to REALLy get everything, you apparently have to have the monthly fee enabled ""unlimited"" feature. Example: I can listen to the Police or Foo Fighters, but no Led Zeppelin - really??? Then it just tries to ""sell you"" the upgrade when you ask it to play something it can't. That's pretty annoying. Looking forward to Apple's version of this. More expensive and still many months away, but since I have an Apple Music account and it will play MY playlists!

Also I found the bare Kindle to be a bit fidgety to hold while reading and I was hoping a cover would give me a better grip.This cover was just released and I like the fact that it has the elastic band to hold it closed like the original Kindle 1, as I had read that the older DX cover did not always stay closed. I got the cover with 1-day local delivery and it just arrived.The cover weighs a bit more than 11 ounces so the Kindle with cover is 30 ounces. This makes it significantly heavier than just the Kindle alone (18.75 oz), however the cover gives you several better ways to hold the Kindle, including open like a book or folded back. If you rest the Kindle on something to take the weight off, it is definitely more comfortable to read with it. My preference is to lie on the couch with the Kindle balanced on my chest/stomach and my left hand holding the top of the left part of the cover open at about 90 degrees.I'd give it 5 stars if it was lighter, but so far I really like it.",4,2,POSITIVE,new kindle dx graphite come yesterday immediately realize need cover nervous put dx pick fear drop scratch s great way carry kindle cover find bare kindle bit fidgety hold reading hope cover well grip cover release like fact elastic band hold close like original kindle read old dx cover stay closed get cover day local delivery arrive cover weigh bit ounce kindle cover ounce make significantly heavy kindle oz cover give well way hold kindle include open like book fold rest kindle weight definitely comfortable read preference lie couch kindle balanced chest stomach leave hand holding leave cover open degree d star lighter far like

"I like the Echo a lot. Mostly because of voice automation with Alexa. I've had my Echo Dot (from Best Buy too) since last November (about eight or nine months) and I like it for my bedroom, but the added speaker on the larger Echo device is much better for listening to news or music.

"I am a power user; there's no other way of putting it. I work in IT and I research the heck out of products before I buy. I had an iPad Mini 2 that was just not up to snuff with iOS 10 so I sold it and bought (and eventually returned) the 2016 Fire HD 8. First let me say it's a great tablet for the price and for probably 50-60% of tablet users who surf the web and watch Netflix. It also helps if you are a heavy Amazon content user. For me, I was spoiled by the retina display on the iPad. The 720p display is alright, but you can see the pixels. 189ppi is pretty low by today's standards. The other big thing for me was the lack of a laminated display. It's glare city on this thing. Display nitpicks aside, it punches above its price point. If you don't play really heavy games (which it even plays Titan Quest surprisingly well!) and you don't mind not having an absolutely beautiful screen I think it runs and works fine. It just wasn't for me.

"At the price it is almost an impulse buy. I wanted a tablet for an upcoming trip to watch some movies, read, etc and this was at a price point that made the decision really easy. If you are used to an iPad, the Fire HD is a little disappointing but it costs considerably less. It fit my needs but I felt some slugginess and several instances of needing to reboot to get certain apps to work correct. If you go in with the understanding this isn't an iPad replacement this should fit the bills for you. Let's just say, after my trip I purchased an iPad Pro and this item will likely be handed off to one of my children.

"I will start with the disclaimer, I am not an Amazon Prime member. I have a feeling this tablet really roars around within the AP environment. Instead, I purchased it to watch YouTube videos, Netflix and Hulu shows, read a few digital books, and maybe other stuff down the road. Yes, there is an app for Hulu and Netflix and YouTube. But the Netflix app stopped seeing my memory card and a reinstall didn't fix it. This means I can't download videos to the 64 GB card I bought.I figured, I should be able to move files back and forth - but that doesn't work. No way to move the content to the card. So I have 64 GB unusable for Netflix and am stuck loading on the 8GB internal memory. When I take this thing on the road, I will have to rely on wifi to replenish titles along the way.The picture is good, though, bright enough and clear. Sound is just ok and I am disappointed by the top volume through both the speaker and the headphone jack - it barely cuts above the fans from my AC. I plan on adding a Bluetooth speaker at some point, but am guessing I will run into a similar issue - how to get more volume.At $50, I am plenty happy with the device, but it should use Android aps better. I know Amazon wants me on prime, but I should still get the best experience possible.",4,2,POSITIVE,start disclaimer amazon prime member feel tablet roar ap environment instead purchase watch youtube video netflix hulu show read digital book maybe stuff road yes app hulu netflix youtube netflix app stop see memory card reinstall didn t fix mean t download video gb card buy figured able file forth doesn t work way content card gb unusable netflix stick load gb internal memory thing road rely wifi replenish title way picture good bright clear sound ok disappoint volume speaker headphone jack barely cut fan ac plan add bluetooth speaker point guess run similar issue volume plenty happy device use android ap well know amazon want prime good experience possible

If you don't have them straight out of the box, great..but, they can develop - and in the great majority of these, they will develop. It is a known issue, and Amazon will (at least for now) replace the tablet at no charge to you. As of now, they have a 'zero dead pixel tolerance policy.' That will likely change (if it hasn't already). As far as operational ability of the tablet, it runs smoothly, and allows for up to a 32gb micro sd card - which I highly recommend, as they are absolutely boiling over with bloatware (if you buy an 8 gig, you'll have about 3.5 available to you). It is a decent tablet for browsing the internet, using as an e-reader (however, the screen isn't as bright as other e-readers), or mp3 player. As they say, you get what you pay for.

First of all I miss Swype. WHY get rid of it? Secondly I cannot put two of my favorite apps (which work on my old one) to work on this but lastly and most importantly: every once in awhile the screen freezes with a bunch of code ""shimmering"" in the background and only turning it off and/or leaving it for awhile brings it back to life AND it turns itself off.

It usually begins with just one, or two, and becomes several over time. It's distracting to reading. In a conventional book, it would be like having a small speck of dirt on the page. If these little things don't bother you, then it's not an issue. The Paperwhite models don't seem to have this problem as often as the Voyage does.

"I owned a Kindle Keyboard for about a year, and I purchased the leather lighted case for that unit. While the corner light left a little to be desired as far as even lighting, overall I was very pleased with the case. Based on that experience, I went ahead and purchased the lighted cover for my new Kindle. I can't say this experience has as been as positive.Let's start off with what's good about the case. The Kindle battery powered light is a big improvement. The light is now centered on the screen, so illumination is more even now. I don't use the light often, but in the cases where I do it will be nice to have more balanced coverage. One positive on the case itself is that I appreciate how much lighter this one feels than the previous generation. The hinge area is smaller, which means less of the spine folding effect the other one took on after heavy use. I never took my Kindle Keyboard out of the case after it was put in, so the snug fit I have seen complaints about is not an issue for me. It IS tight, though, so if you don't plan to keep the case on full time be aware it may take some effort to get it back out. In my situation, that tight fit is exactly what I want, but your mileage may vary.Now on to the negatives. The case does feel very cheap, especially with no change in price point. The previous cover felt like a solidly made piece of work, whereas the new cover only feels half as sturdy. The thinness of the case was no doubt done to minimize its weight, so I realize this is a personal issue. Outside the thickness, though, it just doesn't look or feel as well made. The textured surface of the previous model you that leather feel, very much like a real book. Finally, the most stunning oversight is the lack of a closure device.Read more",3,1,SOSO,own kindle keyboard year purchase leather light case unit corner light leave little desire far light overall pleased case base experience go ahead purchase light cover new kindle t experience positive let s start s good case kindle battery power light big improvement light center screen illumination don t use light case nice balanced coverage positive case appreciate light feel previous generation hinge area small mean spine fold effect take heavy use take kindle keyboard case snug fit see complaint issue tight don t plan case time aware effort situation tight fit exactly want mileage vary negative case feel cheap especially change price point previous cover feel like solidly piece work new cover feel half sturdy thinness case doubt minimize weight realize personal issue outside thickness doesn t look feel textured surface previous model leather feel like real book finally stunning oversight lack closure device read

So I didn't give this much of a chance. First it seems it REALLY wants you to sign up for Amazon Free Time ($4.99 month). Guessing my experience would be a whole lot smoother if I did that.So created the child profile on the tablet, moved the YouTube app to the profile. Opened the app and got selections for Popular, Music, Movies etc... Could not locate a ""search"" feature. After repeated tapping, got Music to open. Only to get a warning that ""this content is restricted in the Amazon Free Time app"". What? So I have to join to unlock YouTube? I'm technically savy so the fact that I was frustrated didn't bear well for the granddaughter. Maybe there was another way around this but I didn't look. Should not have to.Couple this with the random ads for games, Amazon Prime, etc that pops up and that was enough for me.

"An 'okay' reader. Reading from an iPad mini is better under all conditions except outside in sunlight. Plus, with the iPad you can play games, web search, etc. The Kindle library function is not nearly as good as the Kindle app on the iPad where you can see many more of your books on a page and scroll through them all quickly versus the slow swipe function of the Kindle. I also do not like the page turn of the Kindle versus Apple. Every page turned on Kindle is like slow motion and about every fifth page refreshes entirely. I actually have to go to the top of the next page slowly in order to not have to wait for the Kindle slow page turn. Even the reading in the outdoors feature of the Kindle is not as great as reviewers indicate as there is still the sun glare on pages that you have to deal with, although at least you can read with it outdoors. The Kindle also suffers from a 'shadow' along the bottom of the screen. The explanation is that it is actually a shadow that is between the lights that are shining upward for night time reading. Draw your own conclusions as to whether that is good engineering. It is worse on some of the devices I saw than on others. Kindle serves the purpose for reading at the beach and not worrying if it accidently gets damaged. I would never take an iPad to the beach, but the Kindle is almost 'disposable' in contrast. Maybe 3 stars is being a bit generous but it is a good supplement to the iPad. If Apple ever makes their device so it can be used outside without a glare, then I don't see any market for the Kindle at that point. Not sorry I have a Kindle, but for what I decided to buy it for (reading at beach) it is at the price point where it is not really worth it. I still read ""paper"" books for those who remember what those are and those still work perfectly for beach reading.",3,1,SOSO,okay reader read ipad mini well condition outside sunlight plus ipad play game web search etc kindle library function nearly good kindle app ipad book page scroll quickly versus slow swipe function kindle like page turn kindle versus apple page turn kindle like slow motion fifth page refreshe entirely actually page slowly order wait kindle slow page turn read outdoors feature kindle great reviewer indicate sun glare page deal read outdoors kindle suffer shadow screen explanation actually shadow light shine upward night time reading draw conclusion good engineering bad device see kindle serve purpose reading beach worry accidently get damage ipad beach kindle disposable contrast maybe star bit generous good supplement ipad apple make device outside glare don t market kindle point sorry kindle decide buy reading beach price point worth read paper book remember work perfectly beach reading

"Family of 5 and now 6 with Alexa. Seriously she adds another element to our family entertainment and smart home utility.

More often than not, we find ourselves repeating commands. Attempted fix, by using voice training multiple times in areas we are most when aroud Alexa. Saw minor improvement. We also wish the command to increase or lower volume was more efficient. Shouting ""Alexa, volume 5 multiple times after a song you liked was at volume 7 or higher is annoying. We've learned to manually adjust her volume at the base which we can do with our old stereo? I was curious how Alexa would respond to 5 different voice patterns. Surprisingly , once she hears her name and the command prompt, she responds correctly 89% of the time.My wife tells me I'm cheating on ""Siri"" and ""Cortana"" as ""Alexa"" has quickly won my heart and my kids as well. We're glad we went with this, not the dot or google home. If you plan on making voice purchases as commercials advertise, careful- your kids might order 50lbs of cookie dough as Alexa doesn't recognize who's voice is ordering it.

I have books that I do not intend to read often and want them left in the cloud. I am finding it very close to impossible to return any of my books to the cloud - IT SHOULD BE EASIER!!

It's a decent quality tablet for the money. One complaint is the speakers are weak. Have to cup my hand around the speaker side to get some good feedback. The Silk Browser seems to have issues with search engines. Just switching the search engine fixes it though.I got this for when the power goes out at my house. It's served to let me watch netflix. With a bluetooth keyboard it seems adequate for messaging and writing out notes.Video quality is good enough. Though that has more to do with not being super picky about it. I'm considering gifting my dad one of these this year. He commented that the quality looked good. Another complaint would be the amazon app store is limited. No Clash Royale. Which is the only mobile game I actually enjoy. I'm sure there's a way around this. But I'm really not interested in digging around for it.

"I bought a first generation Kindle Fire a few years back, when it was on sale for something like 185.00 and loved it. It took a bit of a beating and I had recently begun to think about buying a replacement. I think that original tablet would probably be more comparable to the Fire HD 10 or something. So my experience with this version is colored by the higher quality first generation model. I also use a Surface Pro tablet as my personal/work computer, so that too probably color my opinion. Out of the box this is lighter than the original. Upon powering up, the original bookshelf carousel is now replaced by a more standard tablet home screen. In terms of processing speed this version feels a little slow. Games I had on the original seem to struggle a bit on the new Fire. Web-browsing is not terrible but is not terribly fast either. In the end, if you want a good e-reader on a budget with a few extra features, this is a great buy. If you're looking for a serious small tablet, you may wish to add a bit more to your budget and get one of the older siblings.",3,1,SOSO,buy generation kindle fire year sale like loved take bit beat recently begin think buying replacement think original tablet probably comparable fire hd experience version color high quality generation model use surface pro tablet personal work computer probably color opinion box light original powering original bookshelf carousel replace standard tablet home screen term process speed version feel little slow game original struggle bit new fire web browse terrible terribly fast end want good e reader budget extra feature great buy look small tablet wish add bit budget old sibling

Otherwise I used it to watch videos, surf the web and use a few social media apps. Good for kids too both videos and games side.

"After all the great reviews I thought it would be wonderful to use as a helping hand running a business solo. However, for this case it isn't very helpful. Unlike Cortana or Siri, Alexa only works with commands based on the petty apps that can generate the commands. It can't use your whole phone or computer to pull up apps or anything special. Even the simple stuff like weather was a hassle to try to change location and simple data like calendar, and anything you want to learn just refers back to the Alexa app which by the way is absolutely awful. You can't use your own calendar alone, everything has to be linked to one of the several lackluster apps that have been created. I think this will be great in the future but as far as offices go, it seems an unnecessary false luxury. At home with smart appliances may be its only use. (Recommended for home entertainment use only).",3,1,SOSO,great review think wonderful use help hand run business solo case isn t helpful unlike cortana siri alexa work command base petty app generate command t use phone computer pull app special simple stuff like weather hassle try change location simple datum like calendar want learn refer alexa app way absolutely awful t use calendar link lackluster app create think great future far office unnecessary false luxury home smart appliance use recommend home entertainment use

"I have to say Alexa has been a great disappointment. Most of the time she doesn't know the answer to anything and tells us that she doesn't understand the question. I thought this thing was supposed to get smarter as it goes along. We had to sign up for AMAZON Prime and Unlimited Music just to actually listen to decent music. When she does know a command for example like say ""Loop Mode"" when you want her to repeat a song... most of the time she understands that. And then there are a lot of times when she simply beeps out or even says she doesn't understand the question no matter how many times you say it. We use her mostly for a timer, alarm, play music and for 6 questions of Jeopardy a day. Really needs a lot of improvement. Ask her what a dog says.. she says bow wow or woof. *Sigh* If she can only be basic on that answer, there isn't much more she is gonna get right.

I don't know why and there does not seem to be any adjustments you can make to that. All you can do is say volume up, volume down or say volume lever 1-10.At no time was I told that you needed to use your smart phone and or table to down load the Alexa App and then run everything through that. Most of the time I say Alexa who is Morris Knight. ""I don't know"" Alexa was Morris Knight a VJ on MTV. ""I don't know"". Alexa can you tell me who was a VJ on MTV ""I don't know"". So I get ""I don't know"" more often then an get and answer. If I do get an answer Alexa will often give me an answer to a for a different person the person I asked about.If you have a Amazon Fire Stick. Don't ask Alexa about a ""MOVIE"" or is Joan Collins in the movie The Virgin Queen. Because for me anytime I use the word ""MOVIE"" she will turn on my Fire Stick. So if you are watching something else you are no longer watching it. She can turn on the Amazon Fire Stick but she can't put your TV back to what you were watching before.The Echo device will often tell you to go to the Alexa App. So I'm really not sure what the Echo Device does.

"This Kindle was purchased on the black friday sale. At the time I felt it was a steal at that price. The first tablet I purchased a few years ago was the original Kindle Fire, the following year I purchased an iPad mini and now have the iPad mini 4. As you may already know, the iPad does not have explandable memory. This Kindle can have expanded memory to 200GB so that was a good selling point for me. After setting this new Kindle Fire up, I noticed that viewing photos were not as clear as the original iPad mini even without retina display, and the color had a greenish-yellowish tint to it. Some may not notice this if they do not have something else to compare it to. I'm a pro photographer so this was quite unaceptable to me. I was not expecting perfection with the colors but people's skin tones appeared greenish as if they were Vulcans. I also like to read tech manuals and magazines of which many are in PDF format. The Kindle will read this format but the Kindle Fire after all these years still cannot display the cover art from pdf books, etc.; it displays an acrobat pdf document logo instead. If you have a large library of pdfs you have to read through the document titles instead of being able to select by seeing the cover of the book. That was enough for me, I've been spoiled by the ease of use of the iPad and the display with accurate colors. Back to the store for a prompt refund it went. Overall..still a good deal but if you are used to an iPad for the reasons I am..you may be disappointed.",3,1,SOSO,kindle purchase black friday sale time feel steal price tablet purchase year ago original kindle fire follow year purchase ipad mini ipad mini know ipad explandable memory kindle expand memory gb good selling point set new kindle fire notice view photo clear original ipad mini retina display color greenish yellowish tint notice compare m pro photographer unaceptable expect perfection color people s skin tone appear greenish vulcan like read tech manual magazine pdf format kindle read format kindle fire year display cover art pdf book etc display acrobat pdf document logo instead large library pdfs read document title instead able select seeing cover book ve spoil ease use ipad display accurate color store prompt refund go overall good deal ipad reason disappoint

Why? Because I realized just how sporadic my reading was. I read when I'm out and about, waiting at a doctor's office, or in-line at a restaurant, etc. It became overwhelmingly apparent to me that the best E-Reader is the one you have with you at all times. For me, that's my iPhone.The actual reading experience is definitely better on the Paperwhite. However, if you're an ""on-the-go"" reader like me, then it just means you have to carry around another device.

"This is not as cheap feeling as I thought it was going to be. It's definitely not in the iPad class but it's not bad for what it is. I ordered online and did not have one in my hands until mine arrived. Pros: The screen is decent, sound is loud enough for me, no lag scrolling and Real Racing 3 plays smoothly. Cons: The major down side is battery charging time, battery life and built in storage space. When it arrived, it was showing 76% remaining. After less than 2.5 hours use, it had to be charged. I just read where it can take 6 hours or longer to charge. My iPad Air 2 can fully charge in a few hours from 0%. Built in storage is not enough. Yes you can get micro SD cards however some apps will only install on the built in storage. Also, you can not delete Amazon apps without voiding the warranty. And unless I'm missing something, you can't move them either.So if you are looking for something to use casually for web surfing, email, watching movies, reading books and the occasional game, this should be just fine...keeping in mind the battery life and lack of built in storage. But you won't be doing any serious work on this like you can on the iPad's. But to be fair, this is 1/10 the price of my iPad Air 2 and 1/8 the cost of an iPad Mini 4.

"The Touch cover from Amazon has some good and some bad properties.On the good side, it's very light: at 4 oz it is noticeably lighter than the previous generation of covers. My Kindle Touch fits in very snugly with no wasted space.On the negative side, it looks and feels rather plasticky. I ordered the plain black version and the front and back outer covers are a shiny black leather. At first I thought the back exterior was simply black plastic, and it took a close examination to realize it is the same leather as the front cover. The front inner cover is a soft felt. The inner body where the Kindle sits is plastic. There is no fastener or band to hold the cover closed.This is my fourth Kindle and cover. The Touch cover looks much more like a gadget cover than the earlier ones. It looks rather like an old Palm PDA cover I had, or like some ipod covers. The previous Kindle covers had a textured leather appearance and they looked more like book or notebook covers.Right now I am having rather mixed reactions. I definitely like the fact that it adds so little weight to the Kindle. However it does look rather cheap. For 40 I was expecting a little more.I think I am going to have to use this for a while before reaching a final conclusion.Update November 29th: Tastes will vary, but in the end I decided that this was not the right look or feel for me and I have switched to a different cover (the Splash SAFARI).

I did not like that you have to download skills to make Alexa have more function. You always had to speak Alexa, and then ask the skill you downloaded. It then gets to a point that you don't even remember what skills you downloaded so you always had to look at your phone or mobile device to see what you had. I exchanged it for the Google Home and it has been a better device. It plays music from Google Music and not only music that you have purchased. It answer a lot of questions and gives you great news briefing instead of downloading the particular skills.

"Pros:- Amazon Prime works on it.- You can still sideload apps, like Kodi.Cons:- Not a good upgrade over the original Fire TV, is worse in some aspects.- Remote buttons are hard to press (compared to original Fire TV)- Remote loses connection frequently and takes several button presses or removing of the remote batteries to fix- Interface isn't as snappy as the original Fire TV- Same interface as the original Fire TV: There's still no good way to sort your apps or locate the Prime content that you want.- Voice search seems about the same as the original Fire TV. Alexa adds nothing significant. You still can't use it to search in 3rd party apps, like Youtube.- As for video decoding in Kodi, performance isn't much better than the original Fire TV. You will be able to play HEVC content at 1080p with no problem, but 1080p .264 hi10p (software-decoded) does not play well. There's simply not enough power. 4k decoding is hit-and miss. It needs to be specifically coded for this Fire TV (low bitrate, low fps) to work properly.- Overall system performance is bad. When sitting idle, the CPUs spike up to 60% usage and memory is at 60% usage.

It never worked at all ~ not even once.Also tried full factory reset on each device, loading the app via a Google Play account, rather than Amazon Kindle account. Google Play wouldn't load the app; said it wasn't compatible with this Kindle device.Opened a ticket on WowWee. The response was that they've had the same experience - the bluetooth on this Kindle fails and so the app doesn't work with the WowWee robots.

"I don't want to get too negative on this, because it does what it's supposed to. However, I'm not sure how Amazon justifies charging 40! Half that and I'd feel a lot less disappointed. It's nothing like the last generation cover, which was hefty and substantial. That thing could take a beating! This one Umm...not so much.PROS:- I really like the solution Amazon came up with to lock the Kindle in place sort of a rubberized cup that grips it on all four sides and holds it VERY securely. No more metal-prong slide-release gizmo.- It looks quite nice and is genuine (if untextured) leather like the last one.CONS:- Flimsy. The leather is extremely thin and unpadded. Won't stand up to much abuse. scrape it even lightly on a rough surface and you'll likely ruin it.- The actual cover that folds over the front is incredibly floppy and delicate -- it's about the thickness of a piece of notepad cardboard. I could bend it in half with almost no effort, if I had the notion.- Cover has no lock/closure mechanism (like the elastic strap on the last gen model). It should have SOMETHING.Oh, well. It is what it is. I never read with the Kindle in the case anyway so it's not such a big deal to me, but I was expecting more.

I bought this thing refurbished. I find that I have to unplug / plug back in the HDMI cable on a regular basis when switching inputs on the TV. Not sure if it is the Amazon Fire box itself or if it is the TV (Not likely).Otherwise it is a good device. I bought it for the ability to hard wire my Ethernet connection to my gigabit switch and for 4K capabilities which it does do. Having the Alexa app is handy but her features can be severely handicapped.I probably should have just bought it new..... usually refurbished devices work well as they are tested before resale and it was probably tough to catch that the HDMI port on these might be finicky.

I got Amazon Music, and needed only to say, ""Alexa, play (insert artist name, song name, or album name)"" and it would play music. The speaker quality is great. 4 days after Christmas it went into a Christmas Music and hymn default. Whatever artist I requested, it would play the first song, and then default to religious music. I'd switch artists and it'd happen again. I contacted Amazon, and was told not to request artists. I needed to specify albums and songs. I don't have this info memorized. I bought it to say artist names. Someone responding to my poor review on Amazon suggested trying different music services. I dumped Amazon music and started requesting music on Pandora. Alexa misunderstood my granddaughters request, and played Christmas music on Pandora, although we were now well into Jan.

"It's somewhat of a step up from the Roku 3 I was previously using, but not as much as I was expecting. I think it's a couple firmware updates away from being better than it is now.Spent the good part of the day trying to figure out why I could only connect to my dual-band router at 2.4GHz and not 5GHz. 1.5 hours on the phone with Verizon FiOS tech support was unsuccessful as other devices connected at 5GHz without issue. Was about to pack it up and return it until I called Amazon tech support. Turns out it's a known-issue that the FireTV has difficulty with 5GHz networks that are set to auto channel selection and are utilizing channel numbers above 100.The tech support person said I should change the channel to 36, 44, or 48 instead of automatic, and, it worked.Bluetooth audio and video are out of sync with Showtime, Netflix, Sling, Plex and Hulu. It's fine through speakers, but video lags slightly behind the audio using Bluetooth. Audio and video are in perfect sync with Bluetooth and Amazon Prime Video which makes me think it'll be fixed at some point, as Amazon provided video demonstrates it can work well in that regard.Gotta say I prefer the platform agnostic UI of Roku, with Amazon-world tucked away in an app. The FireTV navigation pane represents mostly Amazon products with no option to modify it. Roku's UI is more about the media, less about the provider. Voice search works well if you want only to be presented with Amazon's viewing options, for some reason I thought search was universal, but only movies and TV shows available through Amazon show up.

Amazon fire is a good tablet if you like e-books. It's also nice to get a six-month subscription to the Washington Post.

"I bought this to replace a 3-year old Kindle Fire 7"" HDX that I had just dropped on the floor. I sort of panicked, so after doing a couple of hours of research I picked this tablet. Just to be on the safe side I got 16 additional GB of memory.

I can honestly say this is the slowest tablet I've ever had. Just rotating the screen takes 7-10 seconds, and that's if there's only one app open. Opening a book or magazine can take half a minute, and God help you if you want to switch between a recipe and a magazine while you're cooking!

We cannot, however, remove the cover because of the way it hooks into the device, the hook closure must be bent because of the accidental attempt to open the back cover.

We are returning, and spending the extra money for an iPad. Will not purchase another kindle device unfortunately just based on this experience. If you just use the device for reading, maybe this is for you, but trying to download information to SD card and actually being able to access it has been beyond frustrating, as well as having to do factory resets so content owned/ already purchased on Amazon would show up on the device in the library.",1,0,NEGATIVE,read positive review wish well buy great reflection experience product product month contact amazon support perform factory reset content device poorly design sd card pop constantly mess drm good happen connect internet fix return spend extra money ipad purchase kindle device unfortunately base experience use device reading maybe try download information sd card actually able access frustrating have factory reset content own purchase amazon device library

"The reviews on this on Amazon seemed awesome. Little did I know that there is a chronic problem with the port on these tablets. We just bought this for Christmas and went to charge it for the first time. Nothing. We already loaded (and paid for) several apps, and now we're out that money. Also the charging cord that came with it appears it has been used before - there's some wear at the edge of it. So I went online to see if I could find this issue and there it is - everywhere. This is a problem that has been around for years, but Android - who is the ultimate culprit, has failed to fix it at the source. When you plug in the charger, there's no 'click' so you know it's in place. It just slides in and out. We've had Apple products for several years and never had an issue, then the first Droid product we purchase can't even be charged from the beginning.

"Let's be realistic on two fronts about the Echo: (1) I'ts fun to play with, a novel idea. (2) There are some serious flaws and if you doubt me you can try these yourself.

No matter how you phrase the question.(2) ""Alexa, what is the current humidity outside?"". You'll get the days weather report no matter how you pose the question. Seriously, it cannot even provide the Humidity?(3) ""Alexa, Who makes the 747 Jet?"". You'll hear ""Hmmm, I'm not sure what you meant by that question. So throw in a clue with ""Alexa, who makes the Boeing 747 Jet?"" and you'll hear the same answer. And this product is alleged to go out to the web to pull down information from Wikipedia, et al?(4) The reproduction of music is egregious at best.

"I went with this tablet based on many good customer reviews, but my experience was not a good one. From the start I was on the phone every day for at least an hour with Amazon tech support for one issue or another. Most of the techs were very polite, but not all knew the product very well. At one point I asked one of them about trying to save some RAM and they kept referring me to the storage, which told me they didn't even know the difference between RAM and regular storage. The internet browser was basic and it ran very slow at times, even when all my other wifi devices ran great. Then a day would pass and I'd be trying to type an email and the keyboard would just stop working...wtf??? Come to find out it's a ""known issue"" and ""they're working on it"". After two weeks of one thing after another I got fed up and just returned it. I wanted it to work, and gave it a good run, but just not quality stuff. To me it was like Walmart trying to build their own computer when they're obviously not a computer manufacturer, neither is Amazon. If I were you I'd look at a regular Android tablet from a reputable PC manufacturer, which is exactly what I did next. I got an ASUS tablet for only a few dollars more, and it's unbelievable. 1000% better in comparison to the Amazon Fire HD8.

The hinge that attaches to the kindle will eventually put pressure on the kindle front plastic cover and soon you will see it crack.

This is hard to do if you open and close your kindle many times a day or simply lend it to someone else who doesn't know better.

"It's very appealing for the price, but know in advance that the warranty is only 90 days... I did not. So when my sons device stopped charging due to a lose charging port a little over 2 months after he got it, I didn't rush to call. I have been taking care of seriously ill family members so I put customer service on the bottom of my list of priorities since I thought I had time,,, especially knowing that these types of calls can sometimes take hours which I didn't have. Today my son was home sick, so I had the day to do the things at the bottom of my list so I called Amazon. 52 minutes later, after doing all their trouble shooting steps THREE times and being disconnected once, she decided to tell me that my warranty was only for 90 days but she would be happy to help me buy one for only $49.99........ Ok. After I calmly explained to he that that was full price and I wasn't about to spend that again on a device that barely made it two months, she put me on hold and 5 minutes later she told me that they would generously give me $10 off my next purchase.Moral of the story, know before you buy & if you still buy, call the minute the thing breaks, even if that means your mom will be an hour late for chemo I guess.Also, during my 45 minute search for who to call about the defect (since it wasn't on the box) I found the Amazon support number on a thread with at least 200 other people talking about their defective charging ports.

"Bestbuy came through before the holiday better than Amazon--item available, arrived within 2 days, competitively priced. Great service there. My problem is with disappointing performance by Echo. Siri wins over Alexa. Issues encountered:1) a skill will be installed, but Alexa will tell me first, I need to install the skill and second, that the skill is already installed. User is stuck in a do-loop with no response.2) access to quick 1-sentence read from Wikipedia is appreciated, but if you ask 'tell me more,' Alexa's voice is so rushed and computerized, some of the information is unintelligible.3) tons of skills, but so many of them are at a micro level and others are 1-time gimmicks. If you are not careful, you then need a skill to help you with all the skills you've installed.4) responses on some of the more interesting skills are just plain wrong. Vocabulary on word master is limited, so you will told your response is not a word that begins with ""X"" and we have had instances where our correct response on Jeopardy is reported as not correct. In one skill about a magic door (?) a clue is described, but when selected, you are sent backward a step with the same clue offered again. Frustrating and makes you feel you are doing something wrong or not speaking clearly. Children can get frustrated quickly.5) access to music is quirky.

Also for those that were hoping to pick up some extra football via FOX sports network (FS1), that is not happening. You can add the channel free, but in order to watch any content you will still need a cable or satellite subscription which defeats the whole purpose of adding the app for us cord cutters. There is NO way I am signing back up for cable or satellite. I wish FS1 would get with the program and offer a separate subscription such as HBO and Showtime do. It's a thumbs down for me.",1,0,NEGATIVE,basically content roku provide clunki menu well amazon menu layout amazon app roku hope pick extra football fox sport network fs happen add channel free order watch content need cable satellite subscription defeat purpose add app cord cutter way sign cable satellite wish fs program offer separate subscription hbo showtime s thumb
